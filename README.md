# SQL Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects I've worked on using SQL. Below, you'll find brief descriptions of each project along with links to their respective files or repositories.

## Projects

### 1. COVID Portfolio Project
Description: In the COVID Portfolio Project, we dive into the vast pool of global COVID-19 data using SQL Server. This endeavor aims to thoroughly analyze datasets concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on unraveling trends, patterns, and impacts across different geographical areas and timeframes.

### 2. Cleaning Data in SQL
Description: In the "Cleaning Data in SQL" project, we're taking messy housing data and sprucing it up in SQL Server. The idea is to get it ready for analysis by making it cleaner and more organized. We're fixing mistakes, filling in any missing info, and basically making it easier to understand and work with.
